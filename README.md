# Book Management System Using Binary Search Tree

This C++ project implements a Book Management System using a Binary Search Tree (BST). It supports:
- Insertion, deletion, and search of book records by title, author, or category.
- Traversal of books in ascending and descending order.
- Reading book records from a file.
- Displaying books dynamically based on user input.

## How to Run
- Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- Provide a file containing book data or manually input records at runtime.

## Features
- File-based input for large book datasets.
- Object-oriented design for flexibility and reusability.
